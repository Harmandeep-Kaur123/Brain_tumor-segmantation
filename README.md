# Brain_tumor-segmantation
It is a medical image analysis task that involves the separation of brain tumors from normal brain tissue in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal of brain tumor segmentation is to produce a binary or multi-class segmentation map that accurately reflects the location and extent of the tumor.
