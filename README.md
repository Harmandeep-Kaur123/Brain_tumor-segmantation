# Brain_tumor-segmantation
It is a medical image analysis task that involves the separation of brain tumors from normal brain tissue in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The goal of brain tumor segmentation is to produce a binary or multi-class segmentation map that accurately reflects the location and extent of the tumor.

The dataset consists of set of images and masks

The result will be shown visually depicting the brain tumor segment with original image and mask.
